# Data_Types_and_Structures
A complete Python guide to data types and structures. Includes strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, with practical code on mutability, data access, sorting, hashing, and random generation—perfect for learners and coding practice.

Learning Goals

Understand mutability vs immutability and when to use each.

Choose the right structure for speed, readability, and memory.

Apply hashing concepts in dictionaries and sets.

Practice common operations used in interviews and real projects.

What's Inside

Strings: slicing, case methods, immutability, and common operations.

Lists: creation, indexing, append/remove, reverse, sort, and list vs tuple.

Tuples: immutability, indexing, safe constants, and dictionary keys.

Sets: uniqueness, union, intersection, difference, and membership.

Dictionaries: key–value storage, hashing, updates, removals, lookups.

Random data: generate and sort random lists for practice tasks.
